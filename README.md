# Traveling-Salesman-Problem
Heuristic based solution to the TSP, using Genetic Algorithms


## Welcome!

This is a java implementation of a genetic algorithm proposing an approximate solution to the Traveslman Problem in a reasonnable time.

My teammates for this project are Dian BARRY and Ahcene YOUSFI. 

## Organization:

- AlgosGenetiques.pdf is our presentation (slides). You can find a nice UML diagram there

- projet_java/ is our main project. You can open it with your favorite IDE (Netbeans, Eclipse..)
    
    
    
To execute, run the file main.java


The maximum number of generations is set to 1000

Our mutation rate is set to 0.015
